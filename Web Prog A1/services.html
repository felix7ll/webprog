    <h2 class="servicesheader">Healthy Habits</h2>
      <h3 class="servicesheader">Sleep</h3>
        <p class="lorem">Sleep is one of the most vital parts of anyones life, whether you take any advice from this section, it is important for everyone
          to understand just how fundamentally important sleep is in our lives. The better you sleep the more productive you are, the healthier you are, the
          better you feel, the happier you are. The list goes on, the the point is there. <br>
If you are looking to improve upon the quality of your sleep here are some small changes you could make to get the most out of your nightly slumber. <br>
1.	Aim to get between 7-9 hours of sleep<br>
2.	Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same times everyday<br>
3.	Try to get some sunlight in the early morning after waking up, this will help to time you circadian rhythm and make you more tired later on<br>
4.	Make sure your sleeping environment is as dark as possible, block out any light coming from windows and such with blinds or however you can. A cheap facemask can be helpful if you can’t remove some light sources.<br>
5.	Make sure your environment is as quiet as possible<br>
6.	Limit your caffiene intake past midday<br>
7.	Limit blue light exposure before bed, blue light blocking glasses are helpful, but no screens at all is more effective<br>

      <h3 class="servicesheader">Diet</h3>
        <p class="lorem">Eat healthy with these simple tips: <br><br>
          1. Avoid processed foods
        </p>
      <h3 class="servicesheader">Exercise</h3>
        <p class="lorem">Exercising to increase your physical and mental wellbeing can be as simple as going out for a daily walk, whether you make 5000 or 20000 steps, walking is a great way to take some time
           away from your work and allow your mind to decompress whilst getting the benefits of walking. <br>
           Walking burns calories whilst being easy on the joints, unlike running, furthermore going for daily walks exposes you to the sun if it is out, something that also has amazing benefits.
